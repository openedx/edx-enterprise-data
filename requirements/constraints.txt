# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# TODO: Many pinned dependencies should be unpinned and/or moved to this constraints file.

# Stick to the latest LTS version of Django
Django>=3.2,<4.0

# it's experimental, so keep it pinned
tox-battery==0.5.2

# Constrain until https://github.com/datadriventests/ddt/issues/83 is fixed.
