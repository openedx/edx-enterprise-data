# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# TODO: Many pinned dependencies should be unpinned and/or moved to this constraints file.

# pip 25.3 is incompatible with pip-tools hence causing failures during the build process 
# Make upgrade command and all requirements upgrade jobs are broken due to this.
# See issue https://github.com/openedx/public-engineering/issues/440 for details regarding the ongoing fix.
# The constraint can be removed once a release (pip-tools > 7.5.1) is available with support for pip 25.3
# Issue to track this dependency and unpin later on: https://github.com/openedx/edx-lint/issues/503
